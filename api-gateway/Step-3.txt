API Gateway

- This service will be the single entry point for all incoming requests from the client (our React.js frontend).
- It's responsible for routing requests to the appropriate downstream microservice, and it can also handle concerns like security, rate limiting, and logging.

We will use 'Spring Cloud Gateway' for this. It will fetch its configuration from the Config Server and discover other services using the Eureka Server.

"spring-cloud-starter-gateway": Provides the core Spring Cloud Gateway functionality.

"spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client": Allows the gateway to find other services via Eureka.

"spring-cloud-starter-config": Enables the gateway to fetch its configuration from the Config Server.

"spring-boot-starter-actuator": Useful for monitoring and managing the gateway (e.g., viewing configured routes).
