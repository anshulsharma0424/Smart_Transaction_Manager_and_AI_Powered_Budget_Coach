# Spenzr: Smart Transaction Manager & AI Budget Coach üí∏

Spenzr is a comprehensive, full-stack personal finance application designed to provide users with a seamless experience for managing their finances. It combines a personal transaction manager, a group expense splitter, and an AI-powered budget coach into a single, cohesive platform. The entire application is built from the ground up using a modern, scalable microservices architecture.

## ‚ú® Key Features

The application is divided into three core modules:

### Part A: Smart Transaction Manager

  * **Personal Tracking:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for personal income and expense transactions.
  * **Categorization:** Manage custom categories for transactions (e.g., Food, Shopping, Bills).
  * **Reporting:** A simple reporting feature to see total income, expenses, and net balance.
  * **Personalization:** Users can set their preferred currency (INR/USD).

### Part B: Group Expense Splitter

  * **Event Management:** Create and manage group events for trips, parties, or shared living.
  * **Participant Management:** Easily add or remove other Spenzr users to an event.
  * **Group Expenses:** Log expenses within an event, specifying who paid and how the cost is split.
  * **Debt Settlement:** A sophisticated algorithm calculates the simplest way for everyone to settle their debts, showing exactly who owes whom.

### Part C: AI Budget Coach

  * **Asynchronous Processing:** Personal and group expenses are published to an **Apache Kafka** topic for asynchronous analysis.
  * **AI-Powered Insights:** A dedicated AI service consumes the expense data and uses **Google Gemini** to generate personalized, actionable financial tips.
  * **Suggestion Hub:** All generated tips are stored and can be viewed on a dedicated "AI Coach" page.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Spenzr is built on a distributed, granular microservices architecture to ensure loose coupling, scalability, and independent development. All services are registered with a discovery server and communicate via an API Gateway or an asynchronous message broker.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the entire Spenzr application running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

  * Java (JDK 21+)
  * Maven
  * Node.js & npm
  * Docker & Docker Compose

### 1\. Clone the Repositories

You will need to clone the main repository containing all the services and your separate configuration repository.

### 2\. Configure Secrets

The application requires a **Google Gemini API Key**.

  * Get your key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
  * Set it as an environment variable on your system or in your IDE's run configuration:
    ```bash
    export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-real-api-key-here"
    ```

### 3\. Backend Startup Order

The microservices must be started in a specific order.

1.  **Start Infrastructure with Docker Compose:**
      * Navigate to the directory with your `docker-compose.yml` file.
      * Run `docker-compose up -d`. This will start **Kafka** and **Keycloak**.
2.  **Start Core Cloud Services:**
      * Run the **`eureka-server`** application and wait for it to start.
      * Run the **`config-server`** application and wait for it to start.
3.  **Start All Other Backend Services:**
      * You can now start all the other backend microservices in any order (`user-service`, `transaction-service`, etc.).

### 4\. Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd spenzr-frontend
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Create an environment file:**
      * Create a file named `.env` in the `spenzr-frontend` root.
      * Add the following content:
        ```
        VITE_KEYCLOAK_URL=http://localhost:8180
        VITE_KEYCLOAK_REALM=spenzr-realm
        VITE_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID=spenzr-react-client
        VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/v1
        ```
4.  **Run the frontend:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
5.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`. You will be redirected to the Keycloak login page.
